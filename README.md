# EGM722 LST Assignment

## Overview
This Python script calculates Land Surface Temperature (LST) using Landsat 8/9 satellite imagery. It performs a full preprocessing workflow including:

- **NDVI** (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index)  
- **PVI** (Proportional Vegetation Index)  
- **E_C** (Emissivity Correction)  
- **TOA** (Top of Atmosphere Radiance)  
- **BT** (Brightness Temperature)  
- Final **LST output in Celsius**

---

## Folder Setup
Ensure the following bands are present in the downloaded Landsat folder:
- Band 4: B4.TIF (Red)
- Band 5: B5.TIF (NIR (Near Infra-red))
- Band 10: B10.TIF (TIR (Thermal Infrared))

---

## Environment Setup

A sample `environment.yml` file is included for reproducibility. It lists the following required open-source packages:

- `numpy`
- `rasterio`
- `matplotlib`

### Note on `arcpy`

This script requires the **`arcpy`** module to access raster statistics.

- `arcpy` **cannot** be installed using `conda` or `pip`  
- It is **only available through ArcGIS Pro** installations

To run this script successfully, you must:

- Use the **ArcGIS Pro Python Command Prompt**, _or_  
- Use a Conda environment where `arcpy` is already available (e.g. `arcgispro-py3`)

**Users without ArcGIS Pro will not be able to run this script.**

To create the environment (excluding arcpy), run:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lst_env

---

## Running the Script
After activating the correct environment, run the script:

python lst_script.py

You will be prompted to enter the full path to the folder containing your Landsat bands.

## Outputs
Output rasters will be saved in a new subfolder called `Output` inside your Landsat folder:
- `NDVI.tif`
- `PVI.tif`
- `Emissivity.tif`
- `TOA_Radiance.tif`
- `BT.tif` (Brightness Temperature)
- `LST_Celsius.tif`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'arcpy'` | Run from ArcGIS Proâ€™s Python Command Prompt |
| `One or more bands not found` | Check that the correct band filenames are in the folder |
| `PermissionError when saving rasters` | Close the folder in File Explorer and re-run the script |
